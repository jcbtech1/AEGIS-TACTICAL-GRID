# **App Name**: Celestial Weaver

## Core Features:

- Particle Generation: Generate a mesmerizing galaxy of particles using Three.js. Includes controls for adjusting parameters such as particle size, color, and speed. The user can specify a seed or use the tool to make a random seed.
- Interactive Controls: Implement OrbitControls to allow users to freely rotate and zoom around the generated galaxy.
- Color Themes: Allow users to select from a set of pre-defined color themes to quickly change the look and feel of the galaxy. User may request specific combinations and the tool will decide the best.
- Procedural Animation: Animate the galaxy using shaders and time-based uniforms. Provides controls for tweaking the animation speed and intensity. If the user requests new types of movement, the LLM will reason about the combination of values.
- Export Configuration: Allow users to save and load their galaxy configurations as JSON files, to load into the app later, or to share with friends.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) for a cosmic and mysterious feel.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) to provide high contrast and enhance the vibrancy of the particles.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF00FF) to highlight interactive elements and create visual pop.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a modern, tech-inspired aesthetic. Suited for short body texts. Longer text should use 'Inter' as body.
- Use glowing, minimalist icons to represent different controls and settings.
- Incorporate subtle animations on UI elements to enhance user engagement, such as smooth transitions and hover effects.
